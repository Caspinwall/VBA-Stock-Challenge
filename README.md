# VBA-Stock-Challenge
This challenge consisted of writing code in excel vba that analyzes stock prices over the year. The challenge was to create loops that weave through the data and produces an output. 
These outputs were greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume. 
This had to be done for three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Once code was written, it successfully produced the output as desired. 
Another step I would have liked to have seen done is to combine all three years of data into a trend table to see how things have changed over time. 
Screen shots are attached for reference.
